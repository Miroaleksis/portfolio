					<h1>Ellibs</h1>
					<p>The task was to conceptualize an update for Ellibs, a digital library and an audio- and e-book platform. The goal was not to build a definitive design, but a visual model that the client can utilize however they wish to further develop their app later. The update was limited to the core functions of the service, such as reading and previewing a book. The concept was implemented with students as the target user group and with brand guidelines in mind. I was involved in every step of the process but mostly in the prototyping phase.</p>

			<h2>Process summary</h2>
			<p>The first phase was an evaluation of the existing application and the identification of problem areas. We accomplished this by conducting a heuristic evaluation of the application, using Nielsen's ten heuristics. This evaluation helped us pinpoint the core issues of the application. Based on the expert assessment and customer feedback data we received from the client, we began developing the service.<br>
			<br>
			In the end, we created an interactive prototype using Figma. Prototyping was my primary responsibility. We developed the prototype iteratively, conducting A/B testing along the way, which helped make decisions regarding layout and content hierarchy options. Finally, we delivered the prototype to the client along with handoff materials that outlined the design system of the prototype.</p>
