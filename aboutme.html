		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I have originally graduated from Pekka Halonen Academy in 2018 as a visual artisan, area of expertise being graphic design. I have worked in an advertising agency, a web design agency and as a small entrepreneur. Through out years I have become increasingly more interested in functionality of things rather than just their aesthetics and this has steadily lead me to the world of UX &amp; UI. That and an irritation towards many illogical or needlessly complex user interfaces we encounter every day and thinking how I would change them.<br>
		<br>
		In 2021 I began to study UX &amp; UI in Design Institute of LAB University of Applied Sciences. I aim to move into that field of work more in the future although so far I feel like UX &amp; UI education has helped me to become better graphic designer as well. I am very much a team player and having working history in customer service and sales jobs helps me with communication and pitching ideas with customers and team members alike. I also have interest towards game design, screenwriting and storytelling. I often do illustrations as a hobby.</p>
