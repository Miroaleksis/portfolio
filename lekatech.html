					<p>The task was to come up with a UI for an electric breaker hammer. The project was done in collaboration with industrial design students who designed the hammer itself. The hammer-team and the UI-team (me +1) worked separately but with constant check-ups and critiques from one another.<br>
					<br>
					Breaker hammers are used in excavators for mining, quarries, excavation and demolition, the hammer is brought in to chip away at large boulders or concrete structures. Hammering starts when the user presses a pedal with their foot. Earlier the only hammers on the market were hydraulic so electric ones were a new invention. The difference is that the electric hammer can be controlled via a touchscreen device (device we made the UI for) from the excavator cabin so that the impact energy and the frequency of hammering can be changed.<br>
					<br>
					The project started by us studying all the key functions of the hammer and the environment from which it was controlled. Not much user research was possible since there were no pre-existing users. The project was also confidential so we couldnâ€™t share much information about it. We did manage to get some useful information from construction workers: the touchscreen device should be usable with gloves on and should have dim colouring so that the light won't dazzle the operator that might be working in the dark. With these things in mind, we created some wireframes and then two interactive prototypes of the touchscreen UI using Figma. I'll be showing samples of only one of them because I was mostly involved with that one.</p>
